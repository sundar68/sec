            <p className="p10">I am currently enrolled as a senior in the <b>National Institute of Technology Silchar </b>pursuing an undergraduate degree. I am majoring in Computer science and engineering. I am interested in the Web Development field and am seeking exciting opportunities related to the same. I am always curious about things and enjoy learning. I like to solve problems and fix errors. I am a detail orientated person and I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity. I believe that the skills that I have attained from the dynamic environment and competitive university life define me and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any opportunity that I receive.
